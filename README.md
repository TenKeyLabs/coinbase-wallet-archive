# Coinbase Wallet Extension Archive

This repo exists to help out with some CI efforts with [dAppwright](https://github.com/TenKeyLabs/dappwright). It uses [cwv](https://github.com/osis/coinbase-wallet-archive) to track versions of the Coinbase Wallet browser extension and issues a release when a new one is detected.

Assets in the releases are `.zip` but could be renamed to browser specific extensions (ex. `.crx`) since they are functionally the same thing.
